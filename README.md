# SqLite To MS Sql Convert

Transports/Converts schema and data from SqLite to MS Sql.

After searching long and wide for a free tool I decided to create one. It's not perfect and still a work in progress, but if it helps me, it sure can help you.

You can transport schema, data or both. The tool has built in support for data type conversion and supports transporting large Blobs.
